    "First and formost, I have chosen the \"Digit Recognizer\" competition(which is hosted by Kaggle), https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer, as my capstone project. The objective of the project is to classify handwritten digits via MNIST data. Originally, MNIST dataset was developed and compiled from a huge library of scanned document dataset available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology which is also known as \"NIST\". Together, they merged and form the datasets which is also known as the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST).\n",

In general, SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data preprocessing and formatting. It can be seen as similar in flavor to MNIST (e.g., the images are of small cropped digits), but incorporates an order of magnitude more labeled data (over 600,000 digit images) and comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. \n",

In the mobile setting (mobile phones or tablets) writing with a stylus or fingers is convenient compared to typing on a keypad. Another very important use of handwriting recognition would be deciphering historical documents that are fairly degraded. According to my analysis, problem such as handwritten digit recognition should be solved for betterment of uses in domains such as automatic bank-check recognition [1]. This project will focus on classifying single handwritten digit into one of 0 until 9. Handwritten digit recognition is almost a solved problem as deep learning algorithms have achieved a 99% + accuracy on the MNIST database [2]. Neural networks (even the shallow ones) work really well in the digit recognition problems. In my opinion, these research papers are relevant because they contain results that will provide evidence in how well each machine learning algorithms performs.\n",

Convolutional neural network can be used to predict a sequence of digits. This is mainly because the it has the ability to identify images at different scales and work on raw pixels. Convolutional neural networks consist of multiple layers of receptive fields. These are small neurone collections which process portions of the input image. The outputs of these collections are then tiled so that their input regions overlap, to obtain a better representation of the original image; this is repeated for every such layer. One major advantage of convolutional networks is the use of shared weight in convolutional layers, which means that the same filter (weights bank) is used for each pixel in the layer; this both reduces memory footprint and improves performance [3].\n",

    "#### Part 1: Local Receptive Fields\n",
    "<img src=\"input_neuron.png\" style=\"height: 200px;\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In MLPs, the inputs were depicted as a vertical line of neurons. In a convolutional net, it'll help to think instead of the inputs as a 32×32 square of neurons, whose values correspond to the 32×32 pixel intensities that will be treated as inputs. Input pixels will be connected to a layer of hidden neurons(but not every input pixel will be connected to every hidden neuron). Instead, each neurons in the first hidden layer will be connected to a small (localized region) of the input neurons for example, a 5×5 region.\n",
    "\n",
    "That region in the input image is known as local receptive field for the hidden neuron. Each connection learns a weight and the hidden neuron learns an overall bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"slide_1.png\" style=\"height: 200px;\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n",
    "Once the neuron connections have be made, the local receptive field will be slide across the entire input image. For each local receptive field, there is a different hidden neuron in the first hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"slide_2.png\" style=\"height: 200px;\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n",
    "Next, the local receptive field will be slide over by one pixel to the right in order to connect to a second hidden neuron and so on(building up the first hidden layer). Since SVHN datasets consist of 32x32 input images, and 5x5 local receptive fields are used, then there will be a total 28x28 neurons in the hidden layer. This is due to the fact that local receptive field can only be moved 27 neurons across and 27 neurons down, before colliding with the right-hand side (or bottom) of the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2: Shared Weights/Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"weights.png\" style=\"height: 100px;\" style=\"width: 100px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each hidden neuron has a bias and 5×5 weights connected to its local receptive field. The same weights and bias will be implemented on each of the 27×27 hidden neurons. In other words, for the j,kth hidden neuron, the output is shown in the equation above. (σ) is known as the neural activation function, (b) is the shared value for the bias, (wl,m) is a 5x5 array of shared weights (ax,y) will be used to denote the input activation at position (x,y).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shared weights and biases act as filter.As a result neurons in the first hidden layer will be able to identify exactly the same feature(for instance edge of an image or a certain shape) at different locations in the input SVHN images. It is important to apply the same feature detection everywhere in the image. For an example, if the image of a \"1\" is moved by a little, convolutional neural networks will be able to identify it as an image of a \"1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"diagram_1.png\" style=\"height: 200px;\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n",
    "In order to perform image recognition, convolutional neural network requires more than one feature map. Based on the example shown, there are 3 feature maps. Each feature map is defined by a set of 5×5 shared weights, and a single shared bias. The result is that the network can detect 3 different kinds of features, with each feature being detectable across the entire image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 3: Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, pooling layers are utilized immediately after convolutional layers. The purpose of the pooling layers is to convert the output from the convolutional layer into a simplified form(downsampling). The process of pooling usually involves summarizing a region of neurones in the previous layer. It takes each feature map output from the convolutional layer and prepare a condensed feature map. Pooling usually consumes small disjoint portions of the image (typically 2x2) and aggregates them into a single value. To date, there are several possible schemes for the aggregation- the most popular being max-pooling, where the maximum pixel value within each chunk is taken.\n",
    "Max-pooling to will be applied to each feature map separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"max_pooling.png\" style=\"height: 200px;\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it in layman's terms, max-pooling is equivalent to a scanner that checks for certain features in a region of the image and then gives out the exact positional information. Once a feature has been found, its exact location isn't as important as its rough location relative to other features. The advantage is that there are many fewer pooled features, and so this helps reduce the number of parameters needed in later layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final CNN Design:\n",
    "This project makes use of the CNN module of Tensorflow. The final CNN design will be explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"stride_1.png\" style=\"height: 400px;\" style=\"width: 400px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to the diagram above, the input 32x32 images will be injected into the first convolutional layer (CONV 1). Convolution layer is used to get the features of the data. In the case of digit recognition - a shape of each digit. It uses learnable kernels/filters each of which corresponds to one particular shape pattern. The convolution computes 32 features for each 5x5 patch. Its weight tensor has a shape of [5, 5, 3, 32]. The first two dimensions are the patch size, the next is the number of input channels (3 means that images are in RGB format), and the last is the number of output channels. There is also a bias vector with a component for each output channel. To apply the layer, we reshape the input data to a four dimensional tensor, with the first dimension corresponding to the number of images, second and third - to image width and height, and the final dimension - to the number of colour channels. We also implemented stride of 1 where the receptive field is shifted by 1 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"zero_padding.png\" style=\"height: 300px;\" style=\"width: 300px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As we keep applying convolutional layers, the size of the volume decrease faster than we would like. In the early layers of our network, we want to preserve as much information as possible(about the original input volume). In order to do so, we apply zero padding of size 2 to the layer. Zero padding pads the input volume with zeros around the border. This will result in a 36x36x3 input volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes a rectified linear unit(ReLu 1) which combines the first convolution output and the first layer biases. The output dimension remains the same 32x32x32.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"max_p.png\" style=\"height: 200px;\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, the output of ReLu 1 will be passed to the first max pooling layer(MAX POOL 1). Max pooling reduces the dimensionality of the images. As a result, the output becomes 16x16x32.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second layer has 64 features for each 5x5 patch. Its weight tensor has a shape of [5, 5, 32, 64]. The first two dimensions are the patch size, the next is the number of input channels (32 channels correspond to 32 featured that we got from previous convolutional layer), and the last is the number of output channels. There is also a bias vector with a component for each output channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the image is down-sampled by pooling to 16x16 size second convolutional layer picks up more general characteristics of the images. Filters cover more space of the picture. Therefore, it is adjusted for more generic features while the first layer finds smaller details.\n",
    "\n",

Adam is an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning."

    "   3. Adam optimizer have been used for stochastic optimization. Adam offers several advantages over the simple gradient descent optimizer. Foremost is that it uses moving averages of the parameters (momentum); Bengio discusses the reasons for why this is beneficial in Section 3.1.1 of this paper [8]. Simply put, this enables Adam to use a larger effective step size, and the algorithm will converge to this step size without fine tuning. The main down side of the algorithm is that Adam requires more computation to be performed for each parameter in each training step (to maintain the moving averages and variance, and calculate the scaled gradient); and more state to be retained for each parameter (approximately tripling the size of the model to store the average and variance for each parameter).\n",
