    "        - Decision trees model is easily understandable and visualized (process flow) by non-technical audience.\n",
    "        - It requires relatively little effort from users for data preparation.\n",
    "        - Nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect tree performance.\n",
    "        - Decision trees implicitly perform variable screening or feature selection.\n",
    "    3. Weaknesses:\n",
    "        - Decision trees can be extremely sensitive to small perturbations in the data. A slight change can result in           a drastically different tree.\n",

    "        - SVM does not provide probability estimates.\n",

Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
