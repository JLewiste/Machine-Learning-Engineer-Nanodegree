Machine learning represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. This program will teach you how to become a machine learning engineer, and apply predictive models to massive data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more.

## Overview
This repository contains all the projects I did for the Udacity's MLND Program.

The original files (without the answers) can be found in [Udacity's Github ML Repository](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning) and my capstone project can be found [here](https://github.com/lccasagrande/Deep-Knowledge-Tracing).

## Content
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning

## Requirements
You'll need Python to be able to run theses projects. If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which has almost all packages required in these projects. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.
